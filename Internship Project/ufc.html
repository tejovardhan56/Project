    	<h2>CM Punk vs Mike Jackson</h2>
    	<p>
    		Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Welterweights CM Punk and Mike Jackson looked to score their first career victory last night (June 9, 2018) at UFC 225 inside the United Center in Chicago, Illinoise.Punk opened and attempted to work behind the jab, but Jackson stung him early with sharper punches. Punk responded with a flurry that briefly hurt Jackson, and he tried to follow up with a clinch takedown. Jackson resisted, created space, and landed more right hands.Punk finally landed a takedown in the final 30 seconds, making it a reasonably close round.ore than anything else, Punk displayed plenty of heart in taking a beating to survive to final bell.

    	<h2>Holly Holm dominates over Megan Anderson</h2>
    	<p>
        Taking on debuting the Invicta FC star, Holm more or less cruised through all three rounds to earn the unanimous decision victory. Holm was stellar both on her feet and on the ground, and she proved to everyone that she's still a force to be reckoned with in the UFC women's divisions -- at both bantamweight and featherweight.Holm is definitely worthy of a championship opportunity once again, but the only question now is which division she'll receive that shot in. Following the fight when pegged by Joe Rogan about a move back to the bantamweight division to try and reclaim the title she once held, she admitted that's something near and dear to her heart, but she also failed to shoot down staying in the 145-pound ranks to take a second shot at being the woman to hand Cris Cyborg her first loss.

    	<h2> Robert Whittaker vs Yoel Romero fight recap</h2>
    	<p>
    	   Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Middleweight killers Robert Whittaker and Yoel Romero rematched last night (June 9, 2018) at UFC 225 inside the United Center in Chicago.Romero opened the final frame with a hard cross, so Whittaker punted him in the mid-section. The two were landing at a heavy clip, but a big shot from Romero planted him on the mat once again. Whittaker seemed to be in terrible trouble, but he used a single leg takedown attempt to clear his head and eventually get back to his feet. Romero did not let up though, tripping the legs out from underneath “Bobby Knuckles” and dragging him back down to the mat.
           The end result was a split-decision for Robert Whittaker.
