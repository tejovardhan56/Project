    	<h2>Scotland won by 6 runs against England </h2>
    	<p>
    		The top team in the world have lost to the team ranked 13th. And we’ve seen 737 runs in a day. Jonny Bairstow played a scintillating knock, but, to be ultra-critical, it was a baby hundred when a daddy was required. And Alex Hales compounded the problem by stage-managing two dismissals, his own and Joe Root’s. Moeen Ali and Liam Plunkett very nearly turned it round, but the force was with Kyle Coetzer, the captain with a ridiculous number of bowling changes. He set the tone this morning with the bat, and somehow he got his team over the line in the field, helped by some canny bowling from Evans and Watt. It’s been a privilege to cover this. Thanks for your company

    	2nd T20I report: Spin sensation Rashid Khan claimed four wickets to set up Afghanistan's series-clinching win over Bangladesh in the second Twenty20 international on Tuesday in the north Indian city of Dehradun.Khan's 4-12 helped restrict Bangladesh to 134-8 as the hosts surpassed the modest total to win by six wickets and take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.But it was the 19-year-old Khan who set up the victory with his triple strike in an over and was poised to claim a hat-trick after sending back Tamim Iqbal, who top-scored with 43, and Mosaddek Hossain on consecutive deliveries.Abu Hider denied Khan the hat-trick and went on to hit an unbeaten 21 off 14 balls to give the Bangladesh total respect after the visitors elected to bat first.The Asghar Stanikzai-led Afghanistan, who are tuning up for their debut Test against India starting June 14, are scheduled to play the final match of the series on Thursday at the same venue.

    	<h2>CSK are Champions of IPL 2018!!!</h2>
    	<p>
    		A disappointing end to what was an excellent campaign for Sunrisers Hyderabad. They lost momentum in the latter stages of the tournament and that cosy them this title. Nevertheless, they can held their heads high. They made this far without their talisman David Warner which kind of shows how this team doesn't rely on individuals. Williamson ends with the Orange Cap; who would have thought? The title though would have pleased him more. Now the question is: when Warner returns next year, who will captain the side?
