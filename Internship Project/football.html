    	<h2>Real Madrid vs Barcelona </h2>
    	<p>
    		Gareth Bale hit a sublime equaliser for Real Madrid against champions Barcelona, who survived playing with 10 men for 45 minutes to move to within three games of going the entire La Liga season undefeated.Sergi Roberto was shown a straight red card with the score 1-1 at the end of the first half of an ill-tempered El Clasico after he appeared to slap Real defender Marcelo.Roberto had earlier provided the cross for an unmarked Luis Suarez to fire the hosts into the lead before Cristiano Ronaldo bundled the equaliser after Karim Benzema's downward header.Lionel Messi put the champions 2-1 ahead on the counter-attack only for Bale to level with a sweetly struck first-time finish.Real's Ronaldo was substituted at half-time after suffering an ankle sprain while scoring.

    	<h2>India vs Kenya</h2>
    	<p>
        Skipper Sunil Chhetri continued his superb form, striking a brace as India thrashed Kenya 2-0 to clinch the Intercontinental Cup at the Mumbai Football Arena here on Sunday. Chhetri, who scored in the eighth and 29th minutes to hand India a convincing victory, also equalled Argentina's Lionel Messi's tally of 64 international goals, making him the joint-second active international goalscorer behind Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo (81 goals). With the stadium jam-packed with Indian fans, the hosts started on an aggressive note as they penetrated the Kenyan defense twice in the first minute.

    	<h2>FIFA World Cup 2018:</h2>
    	<h3> Notable teams that failed to qualify</h3>
    	<p>
    	     The U.S. men's national soccer team's mid-October defeat to Trinidad and Tobago is a startling failure many U.S. soccer fans are struggling to come to grips with, and they likely won't until after the 2018 World Cup is completed.This is happening elsewhere, too. And as shocking as it was for the USMNT to not qualify for this year's World Cup, it was far from being the most shocking World Cup qualifying failure of them all.These are the "Holy (bleep)! These teams aren't going to the World Cup?" teams of 2018.
